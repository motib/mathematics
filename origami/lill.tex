\section{Magic}\label{s.magic}

Construct a path consisting of four line segments $\{a_3,a_2,a_1,a_0\}$ of lengths:
\[
\{a_3=1,a_2=6,a_1=11,a_0=6\}\,,
\]
starting from the origin, first along the $x$-axis and turning $90^\circ$ counterclockwise between segments. Construct a second path as follows: draw a line from the origin at an angle of $63.4^\circ$ and mark its intersection with $a_2$ by $P$. Turn left $90^\circ$, draw a line and and mark its intersection with $a_1$ by $Q$. Turn left $90^\circ$ once again, draw a line and note that it intersects the end of the first path at $(-10,0)$. %See Figure~\ref{fig.magic}.

Let $p(x)=a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0=x^3+6x^2+11x+6$. Compute $\tan 63.4^\circ=2$, the tangent of the angle at the start of the first path. Then:
\[
p(-\tan 63.4^\circ)=(-2)^3+6(-2)^2+11(-2)+6=0\,.
\]
Congratulations! You have found a root of the cubic polynomial $x^3+6x^2+11x+6$.

\section{Introduction}
This example demonstrates a method discovered by Eduard Lill in 1867 for graphically finding the real roots of any polynomial \cite{bradford, hull-beloch, riaz}. We limit the presentation to cubic polynomials.

Clearly, this is not an algebraic method of computing roots of cubic equations; in the example, we are essentially verifying that $-2$ is a root. Lill's method has seen renewed interest because it can be implemented using origami \cite{hull-beloch}.

In Sections~\ref{s.multiple}--\ref{s.noroots} we continue the initial example to find additional roots and to show that if an angle $\alpha$ is such that $-\tan\alpha$ is \emph{not} a root, then the construction doesn't work.

Section~\ref{s.method} presents the full specification of Lill's method. Some of the description may be difficult to understand, but will be clarified when demonstrated by additional examples in Sections~\ref{s.negative}, \ref{s.zero}, \ref{s.noninteger}. Since Lill's method can find a real root of any cubic polynomial, it can be used to trisect an angle. Since it can find $\sqrt[3]{2}$ as a root of $x^3-2$, it can double a cube as shown in Section~\ref{s.cube}.

Section~\ref{s.proof} gives a proof that Lill's method can find the real roots of any cubic polynomial. The proof for arbitrary polynomials follows the same structure.

\section{Multiple roots}\label{s.multiple}

Let us continue the example above. The polynomial $p(x)=a_3x^3+6x^2+11x+6$ has three roots $-1,-2,-3$. Computing the arc tangent of the negation of the roots gives:
\[
\alpha=-\tan^{-1} -1 = 45^\circ,\quad \beta=-\tan^{-1}-2 = 63.4^\circ,\quad \gamma=-\tan^{-1} -3= 71.6^\circ\,.
\]
In the diagram below we see that for each of the three angles, the second path intersects the end of the first path.

\section{Paths that do not lead to roots}\label{s.noroots}

Perhaps the second path intersects the end of the first path for \emph{any} initial angle, for example, $56.3^\circ$. In the following diagram, the second path intersects the extension of the line segment for the coefficient $a_0$, but not at $(-10,0)$, the end of the first path. We conclude that $-\tan 56.3=-1.5$ is \emph{not} a root of the equation.

\section{Specification of Lill's method}\label{s.method}

This section gives the complete specification of Lill's method for finding real roots of cubic polynomials. Examining the examples below will help understand the details.
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with an arbitrary cubic polynomial: $p(x)=a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$.
\item Construct the first path as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each coefficient $a_3,a_2,a_1,a_0$ (in that order) draw a line segment starting at the origin $O=(0,0)$ in the positive direction of the $x$-axis. Turn $90^\circ$ counterclockwise between each segment.
\end{itemize}
\item Construct the second path as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We use $a_i$ to denote the side of length $a_i$.
\item Construct a line from $O$ at an angle of $\theta$ with the positive $x$-axis that intersects $a_2$ at point $P$.
\item Turn $\pm 90^\circ$ and construct a line from $P$ that intersects $a_1$ at $Q$.
\item Turn $\pm 90^\circ$ and construct a line from $Q$ that intersects $a_0$ at $R$.
\item If $R$ is the end point of the first path, then $-\tan\theta$ is a root of $p(x)$.
\end{itemize}
\item Special cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item When drawing the line segments of the first path, if a coefficient is negative, draw the line segment \emph{backwards}.
\item When drawing the line segments of the first path, if a coefficient is zero, do not draw a line segment but continue with the next $\pm90^\circ$ turn.
\end{itemize}
\item Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item "Intersects $a_i$" includes ``intersects with the line that contains $a_i$''.
\item When building the second path, choose to turn left or right by $90^\circ$ so that there is an intersection with the next segment of the first path.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Negative coefficients}\label{s.negative}

Section~\ref{s.ax6} gave an example of the use of Axiom~6 which resulted in the polynomial $p(x)=x^3-3x^2-3x+1$ that has negative coefficients.

We start by drawing a segment of length $1$ to the right. Next we turn $90^\circ$ to face up, but the coefficient is negative, so we draw a segment of length $3$ \emph{down}. After turning $90^\circ$ to the left, the coefficient is again negative, so we draw a segment of length $3$ to the right. Finally, we turn down and draw a segment of length $1$.

We start the second path with a line angled $45^\circ$ with the $x$-axis. It intersects the \emph{extension} of the line segment for $a_2$ at $(1,1)$. Turning $-90^\circ$ (to the right), the line intersects the \emph{extension} of the line segment for $a_1$ at $(5,-3)$. Turning $-90^\circ$ again, the line intersects the end of the first path at $(4,-4)$.

Since $-\tan 45^\circ=-1$, a real root of the polynomial is $-1$:
\[
p(-1)=(-1)^3-3(-1)^2-3(-1)+6=-1-3+3+1=0\,.
\]
The loosely dashed lines in the Figure will be discussed  in Section~\ref{s.noninteger}.

\section{Zero coefficients}\label{s.zero}

$a_2$, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the polynomial $x^3-7x-6=0$, is zero. For a zero coefficient, we ``draw'' a line segment of length $0$, that is, we do not draw a line, but we still make the $\pm 90^\circ$ turn before ``drawing'' it, as indicated by the arrow pointed up at point $(1,0)$ in the diagram. Next make an additional turn and draw a line of length $-7$, that is, of length $7$ backwards, to point $(8,0)$. Finally, turn again and draw a line of length $-6$ to point $(8,6)$.

There are three second paths that intersect the end of the first path. They start with angles of:
\[
\alpha=45^\circ,\; \beta=63.4^\circ,\; \gamma=-71.6^\circ\,.
\]
We conclude that there are three real roots:
\[
-\tan 45^\circ=-1,\; -\tan 63.4^\circ =-2,\; -\tan -71.6^\circ=3\,.
\]
Check:
\[
(x+1)(x+2)(x-3)=(x^2+3x+2)(x-3) =x^3-7x-6\,.

\section{Non-integer roots}\label{s.noninteger}

Consider the polynomial $p(x)=x^3-2x+1$. The first path goes from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ and then turns up. The coefficient of $x^2$ is zero so no segment is drawn and the path turns left. The next segment is of length $-2$ so it goes backwards from $(1,0)$ to $(3,0)$. Finally, the path turns down and a line of length $1$ is drawn from $(3,0)$ to $(3,-1)$.


It is easy to see that $1$ is a root of $p(x)$. Since $-\tan^{-1} -45^\circ=-1$, there is a path $\overline{OP_1Q_1A}$.

 If we divide $p(x)$ by $x-1$, we obtain the quadratic polynomial $x^2+x-1$ whose roots are:
\[
\disfrac{-1\pm\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 0.62,\; -1.62\,.
\]
Therefore, there are two additional second paths: one starting with an angle of $-31.8^\circ$ since $-\tan^{-1} 0.62=-31.8^\circ$, and one starting with $58.3^\circ$ since $-\tan^{-1}1.62=58.3^\circ$.

Similarly, the polynomial in Section~\ref{s.negative} has roots $ 2\pm\sqrt{3}\approx 3.73, 0.27$. The corresponding angles are $-75^\circ$ and $-15^\circ$, because $(-\tan -75^\circ)\approx 3.73$ and $(-\tan -15^\circ)\approx 0.27$.

\section{The cube root of two}\label{s.cube}

To double a cube we need to compute $\sqrt[3]{2}\approx 1.26$ which is a root of the cubic polynomial $x^3-2$. In the construction of the first path, we turn twice without drawing any line segments, because $a_2$ and $a_1$ are both zero. The first segment of the second path is drawn at an angle of $-51.6^\circ$ and $(-\tan -51.6^\circ)\approx 1.26\approx \sqrt[3]{2}$.

\begin{comment}
Once we have a real root of two, we can compute the two complex roots as follows. Since $\sqrt[3]{2}=\sqrt[3]{2\cdot 1}=\sqrt[3]{2}\cdot\sqrt[3]{1}$, it is sufficient to find the cube roots of one, that is, the roots of the polynomial $x^3-1$. One root is $1$ and dividing by $x-1$ gives a quadratic equation:
\[
x^3-1=(x-1)(x^2+x+1)\,.
\]
Now use the formula for finding the roots of a quadratic polynomial:
\[
r=\disfrac{-1\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2}=\disfrac{-1\pm\sqrt{1-4}}{2}=\disfrac{-1\pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}\,.
\]
Check that:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{2}\cdot \disfrac{-1\pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^3=2\,.
\]

\section{Proof of Lill's method}\label{s.proof}

We limit ourselves to monic cubic polynomials $p(x)=x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$.\footnote{If the polynomial is not monic, divide it by $a_3$ and the resulting monic polynomial has the same roots.} In the diagram below, segments of the first path are labeled with coefficients and with $b_2,b_1,a_2-b_2,a_1-b_1$.

Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$, in a right triangle if one acute angle is $\theta$, the other is $90^\circ-\theta$. Therefore, the angles above $P$ and the angle to the left of $Q$ are equal to $\theta$. We now derive a sequence of formulas for $\tan \theta$:
\begin{form}{1.5}
\tan \theta &=& \disfrac{b_2}{1}=b_2\\
%a_2-b_2&=&a_2-\tan\theta\\
\tan \theta &=& \disfrac{b_1}{a_2-b_2}=\disfrac{b_1}{a_2-\tan\theta}\\
b_1&=&\tan\theta (a_2-\tan\theta)\\
\tan \theta &=& \disfrac{a_0}{a_1-b_1}=\disfrac{a_0}{a_1-\tan\theta(a_2-\tan\theta)}\,.
\end{form}
Simplifying the last equation gives:
\begin{form}{1.2}
(\tan\theta)^3-a_2(\tan\theta)^2+a_1(\tan\theta)-a_0&=&0\\
-(\tan\theta)^3+a_2(\tan\theta)^2-a_1(\tan\theta)+a_0&=&0\\
(-\tan\theta)^3+a_2(-\tan\theta)^2+a_1(-\tan\theta)+a_0&=&0\,.
\end{form}
We conclude that $-\tan\theta$ is a real root of $x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$.
